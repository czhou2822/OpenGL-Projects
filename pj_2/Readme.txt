In this project, I will load a mesh stored in the .ply file format, render it as a 3D wireframe model using Vertex Buffer Objects and also add keyboard control that lets me move the .ply file around. 

Keyboard: 
'W': reset to initial position from the viewer. 

'N': load next drawing.

'P': load previous drawing.

'X': move along x axis 

'x': move along -x axis 

'Y': move along y axis 

'y': move along -y axis 

'Z': move along z axis 

'z': move along -z axis 

'R': X-roll

'B': pulsing, breath effect

'm': m function did not work

'h': increase y-axis shreading

'H': decrease y-axis shreading
